# devRant Browser

This is a python script that parses devrant.io feed using BeautifulSoup and prints right on your terminal. It also converts images to ascii art by using hit9's [img2txt](https://github.com/hit9/img2txt).

# Usage
```
source venv/bin/activate
./main.py
```


# TODO

1. Add rant posting
2. Add Image/gif attachments to rants by specifying URL
3. User page browsing
4. ~~Optimize img2ascii conversion~~ 
5. ~~Remove BeautifulSoup, parse data directly from api~~ Can't do this, because I don't have access to all API Urls.
