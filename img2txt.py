Options:
  -h --help             show this screen.
  --ansi                output an ANSI rendering of the image
  --color               output a colored HTML rendering of the image.
  --antialias           causes any resizing of the image to use antialiasing
  --dither              dither the colors to web palette. Useful when converting 
                        images to ANSI (which has a limited color palette)  
  --fontSize=<n>        sets font size (in pixels) when outputting HTML,
                        default: 7
  --maxLen=<n>          resize image so that larger of width or height matches
                        maxLen, default: 100px
  --bgcolor=<#RRGGBB>   if specified, is blended with transparent pixels to
                        produce the output. In ansi case, if no bgcolor set, a
                        fully transparent pixel is not drawn at all, partially
                        transparent pixels drawn as if opaque
  --targetAspect=<n>    resize image to this ratio of width to height. Default is 
                        1.0 (no resize). For a typical terminal where height of a 
                        character is 2x its width, you might want to try 0.5 here

        It is not possible to correctly dither in the presence of transparency without knowing the background
        that the image will be composed onto. This is because dithering works by propagating error that is introduced 
        when we select _available_ colors that don't match the _desired_ colors. Without knowing the final color value 
        for a pixel, it is not possible to compute the error that must be propagated FROM it. If a pixel is fully or 
        partially transparent, we must know the background to determine the final color value. We can't even record
        the incoming error for the pixel, and then later when/if we know the background compute the full error and 
        propagate that, because that error needs to propagate into the original color selection decisions for the other
        pixels. Those decisions absorb error and are lossy. You can't later apply more error on top of those color
        decisions and necessarily get the same results as applying that error INTO those decisions in the first place.   
        
        So having established that we could only handle transparency correctly at final draw-time, shouldn't we just 
        dither there instead of here? Well, if we don't know the background color here we don't know it there either. 
        So we can either not dither at all if we don't know the bg color, or make some approximation. We've chosen 
        the latter. We'll handle it here to make the drawing code simpler. So what is our approximation? We basically
        just ignore any color changes dithering makes to pixels that have transparency, and prevent any error from being 
        propagated from those pixels. This is done by setting them all to black before dithering (using an exact-match 
        color in Floyd Steinberg dithering with a web-safe-palette will never cause a pixel to receive enough inbound error
        to change color and thus will not propagate error), and then afterwards we set them back to their original values. 
        This means that transparent pixels are essentially not dithered - they ignore (and absorb) inbound error but they
        keep their original colors. We could alternately play games with the alpha channel to try to propagate the error 
        values for transparent pixels through to when we do final drawing but it only works in certain cases and just isn't 
        worth the effort (which involves writing the dithering code ourselves for one thing).
