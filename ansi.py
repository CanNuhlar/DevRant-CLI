DESIGN NOTE (Global Optimization)
The code in this file currently implements "local optimization" to minimize the cost of moving
the cursor around and changing colors. However, it always follows a top-to-bottom left-to-right
path. There are scenarios where choosing a different path would yield a more optimal result
(smaller output size). I have not bothered to implement any global optimization because I
think it will rarely produce a better output.
Here's an example of a scenario where a global optimization of cursor movements that didn't just
 go scanline by scanline top to bottom left to right would be a win:
For example, assume this pattern is to be drawn, beginning at x=0 (SOL)
XXX      XXX
   XXX      XXX
      XXX      XXX              
Drawing it top down/left to right we must do 13 operations: 
    XXX, move right, XXX, \n, move right, XXX, move right, XXX, \n, move right, XXX, move right, XXX  
Drawing it in an optimal sequence we can do 11 operations:
    XXX, move down, XXX, move down, XXX, move up, XXX, move down, XXX, move down, XXX
However, since \n is cheaper than move down, we actually would need blank lines between the XXX lines
to really make the second case smaller in terms of bytes (vs operations).
The discussion above covers cursor changes, but of cours color changes play a role as well. If we were
to assume the XXX on the left were one color while the XXX on the right were another, we'd also save four
color change operations.
To perfectly implement global optimization, you essentially need to solve a variant of the Traveling 
Salesman Path Problem (TSPP) as I discuss here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20032768/graph-traversal-with-shortest-path-with-any-source/33601043#33601043
We could use the single fixed endpoint variant (P*s) from the Hoogeveen paper. Note that each character
we want to output is essentially a node in the graph, and the graph is fully connected (can move from
any character to any other via cursor moves, changing color as needed). Some edges are free (moving right
while outputting character of same color). It is actually an asymmetric TSP because there are cases
where e.g. moving right is free and moving left is not, and moving down to SOL via \n costs 1 while moving
back up to the x pos could be several bytes. Can solve asymmetric TSP via conversion to symmetric.
Solving a TSPP is generally computationally infeasible, so approximation algorithms such as Hoogeveen's are used.
Hoogeveen run O(n^3) so it too may be too slow. Can reduce n by combining runs of same color - I haven't bothered
to prove it but I believe that this does not harm the optimality of the result. Note that this does not reduce
the worst case n - you can a case where there are no such runs. I believe that there are faster algorithms
that provide worse (or zero) optimality guarantees - e.g. Lin Kernighan or nearest neighbor. These might be geared
to solve TSP vs TSPP - though a solution to TSP is also a solution to TSPP, just with the cycle completed and 
no prescribed starting location. We would remove the cycle completing hop, and output a move to the chosen start
location as needed. The algorithms might also be adaptable to TSPP directly. 
If TSPP solvers can never be made fast enough, heuristics can likely be employed to good effect.
Solutions from a TSPP solver might be a good way to find such heuristics.
ANSI codes to save/restore cursor pos could open new vistas of global optimization since you can
restore x/y in only 3 bytes but they are seemingly not supported in Mac xterm so I don't use them.
